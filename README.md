## Abstract
In this project, we proposed a comprehensive data platform, namely **Yelp Insight**, for customers, business owners, and administrators. The highlights of our project can be concluded as follows: 1. We added more than 10,000 entries of Yelp data using the customized web crawler, and 180,000 rows of features via large language model generation techniques. 2. We carefully explored the characteristics of our Yelp dataset and presented many interesting insights into Yelp. 3. We provide more than 100 queries via the combination of our basic queries and flexible parameters, which could cover a wide range of demands from customers, business owners, and platform administrators. 4. We built a demo website that can provide data access services via a non-coding interface.
